Hello world! I recently got the opportunity to write a blog for my work 
about using Elasticsearch's snapshot and restore API to sync clusters across environments.
It was so much fun doing the work and writing the blog that I decided to share it on my own blog, which I am starting now. 

You can find that blog post [here](http://www.yodletechblog.com/2016/06/23/elastic-restore/)
