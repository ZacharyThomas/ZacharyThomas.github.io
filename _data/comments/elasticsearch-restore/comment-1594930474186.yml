message: "Tomkins and ginn cruise into semis for final\n\nSUMMARY\n\nAfter a difficult first weekend, the 2015 Volvo Volvo Car of the Year continues to climb the leaderboards, with a final result showing the team's strength and stability as it looks to get on top again for the championship.\n\nBoth the SkÃ¥ne, who are aiming for the points position after Sunday's second-place finish, and the Volvo of Sweden's Alex Sibikov, who finished fourth last weekend, are looking forward to the third-place battle. A repeat of last year can only help their title aspirations, as all three drivers and coach Peter MÃ¸ller will be watching the battle from a window in the garage.\n\nThe first half of the season has been more or less dominated by the SkÃ¥ne, as it has won 12 of the 13 races in the regular season. The Swedes have proved their continued reliability in qualifying and have even made it to the third round at the Swedish track at the hands of the SkÃ¥ne this year.\n\nThe SkÃ¥ne's pace has become a bit better in the semi-finals, as it took fourth place at the Hungaroring in mid-April and they reached the points in both the V50 and S50 categories, although both of those races were by a significant margin. It will be interesting to see if this improvement continues after Sunday's race, as neither team looks well placed to take down the Volvo Car of Champions again.\n\nThe Volvo Car of Sweden will start with more than the same equipment as its team-mates in the Swedish car but one more new, more advanced version of the Volvo. Volvo CTO Jens Jansen has made it clear that the car has to have a \"battery life\" beyond 30,000 kilometers before it will be considered for sale. The Volvo of Sweden's last performance-related update was in March 2014, when they rolled out four new engines, which in turn added about 600 horsepower to the 2.8-liter DOHC 16-valve turbo engine.\n\nThere's some progress to be made on this front, with both the S50 and V50 being equipped with three-speed automatic gearboxes. They are identical in many areas, but one difference is that the S50's paddle-shifter is located on the left foot and the V50's is located on the right foot. The Volvo of Sweden's paddle-shifter, however, is a hybrid, as the left foot is moved to make room for the paddle shaft.\n\nDespite this change, the P-car remains remarkably similar to the previous-generation SV, although it's now on a much larger platform. The engine is a single-cylinder (6.4 liters / 148 HP) \r\n<a href=https://www.khangheshlaghi.com/>카지노사이트</a>\r\n \r\nUnion steps up campaign to change compo act\n\nThe committee was launched with the launch of \"the campaign to get the Compo Act changed\".\n\nIn a petition, it says that the Compo Act was introduced more than 15 years ago in response to pressure from religious organisations and the state government to grant an exemption from secular law in their localities to Muslim, Parsi, Dalit and Hindu students in a bid to curb \"inseparable communal interests\".\n\nThe petition claims that if students of the religious faith are not allowed to attend the national school due to a compo act exemption, it will affect the quality of education offered to students.\n\nBJP's Pratap Bhattacharjee has been accused by some quarters of stoking communal fears.\n\n\"The state government should change its compo act with a view to ensuring a secular education.\"\n\n\n\"The act was brought to the Centre with the vision of promoting the interests of all sections of society, and not only Muslims. There were some schools where the religious school has been allotted the compo- act exemption, but the Compo Act is a different category,\" said Jai Prakash Reddy, member of the BJP's State Group.\n\nThe petition also has supporters such as the Christian community.\n\n\"I don't want to see a single religious school where Muslim kids are not allowed to go. That may create more trouble for the Muslim students.\" \r\n<a href=https://www.forexlingo.com/>온라인카지노</a>"
