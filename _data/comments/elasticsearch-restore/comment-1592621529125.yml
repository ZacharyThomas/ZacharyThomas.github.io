message: "Stallings sets memorial pace tiger four back to full health\n\n\nLancashire County Council has approved a Â£300,000 fund for a three-year memorial campaign to remember four beloved cats rescued from the brink of death after eating tiger liver.\n\n\nThe five-year memorial programme has been approved by councillors and has been approved by Lord Mayor of Cheltenham, Sir Ian Wood.\n\n\nFamilies will be able to sign up for a membership and send a letter to the Mayor expressing their wishes, and the memorials will be displayed throughout the county.\n\n\nIn total over Â£300,000 has already been raised to the fund, with proceeds raised from fundraising events in other parts of the county also making a contribution towards the cause.\n\nThe cats, born at the Royal Lancashire Veterinary Hospital in February 1995, are currently being nursed and cared for at a hospital in Manchester.\n\n\nAfter their lives as pets became the subject of the campaign, and as part of the community's ongoing interest, the family of the cats, William and Kate Richardson, asked supporters for donations.\n\nThe cats had no idea they were going to grow up as pets, and were left at risk due to a combination of over-caring and neglect.\n\nThey had also recently been abandoned, and the brothers had been taking care of them at a home in Milton Keynes when a fire ripped through their small rural community.\n\n\nWife Jamie Richardson told BBC Radio Devon: 'I just can't believe how lucky these kids were to be alive and well and that they have survived.'\n\nThe cats had no idea they were going to grow up as pets, and were left at risk due to a combination of over-caring and neglect. They had also recently been abandoned, and the brothers had been taking care of them at a home in Milton Keynes\n\nThey both suffered severe burns to their stomach, left them with no hair on their paws, and the injuries would eventually have required them to relearn how to walk\n\nThe fundraising event in November saw donations reaching Â£30,000 in four days.\n\nOne person who was asked to sign up was Elizabeth Burt, of Luton, who is understood to have volunteered to be responsible for providing a postcard to mark the occasion so people could tell their stories.\n\nThe campaign's website explains the cat memorial campaign as a three-year plan to raise money for the cat welfare charity, Save the Cat, which has now adopted 12 cats since the campaign was launched.\n\n\nSince April 2006 the cat welfare charity has had 15 different cat shelters across the county - from North Devon, Cumbria and Kent - and one of them is in Milton Keynes, home to some of the oldest cat adoption centres in the country.\n\n \r\n<a href=https://www.gohappyclub.com/>더킹카지노</a>\r\n<a href=https://www.grupo-huk.com/>바카라사이트</a>\r\n \r\nInterview steve schrenkker at March 28, 2011 11:29 PM\n\nI believe this is a serious incident and I'm sure it will be investigated very thoroughly. Also the only thing I can think of is how this incident could have possibly been so easily avoided if it was just about a single incident to begin with. If someone is looking for a job, why would anyone go through the trouble of trying to find one? What are they really looking for? And they have nothing. We should be focusing on other people, not our own.\n\n\n---\n\n\nIf the information you mention is true, this makes no sense at all.\n\n\n---\n\nSTEVE SCHENKER\n\nMarch 28, 2011 3:43 PM\n\nHello steve,\n\nI would love to hear from you regarding this, but I can't, sorry. I'm just not sure what to say. I'll keep posting here.\n\n-Scott.\n\nMarch 28, 2011 5:08 PM\n\nA: I am going to post on all of these issues to help answer your questions. I've started trying to make a more clear statement about what we all saw in the videos at this time. If I haven't done it by now, I am planning to write about it.\n\nI am grateful for your time and I hope you'll keep up with my posts there!\n\nMichael\n\nMarch 28, 2011 5:55 PM\n\nHi Scott.\n\nI had already looked into this and was able to determine that the incident is indeed a hoax and the woman involved is nothing more than a publicity stunt for the videos I had made and uploaded to various website the day before. I wish I could have told you what I did, but the way they handled it I'm convinced I was just another stupid huckster who posted stupid videos for the money to make up for what a small group of people would try to do to hurt me. Now that I've given you the names of the \"babies\" of who are doing this and how they act, you'll know who to blame! They've started a campaign called The Anonymous Campaign, and I'm sure you'll agree they have not been playing along.\n\n\nYou should probably take a look at this website, they offer all of this information to help get you back on the right track for your career and personal life:\n\n\nhttp://www.theanonymouscampaign.com\n\n-Stefan\n\nMarch 28, 2011 6:08 PM\n\nDear Michael,\n\nI was very upset about all of this the other day and was pretty sure there was an \"evil person\" behind it that wants to destroy all of us. I had to go to an emergency room that da"
