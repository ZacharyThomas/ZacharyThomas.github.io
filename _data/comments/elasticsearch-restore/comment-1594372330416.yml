He finished with 20.6 points, 4.5 assists and 2.7 rebounds, to go with 6.6 assists and 6.8 boards per 36 minutes in the postseason.\n\n\"We're not looking for him to be a star,\" said John Rauch, a former assistant coach at Indiana who now serves as a college sports reporter at MLive.com. \"Just a good player. He knows how to play and gets on the floor. He's a pretty smart player, a good passer. His vision's getting better each week, he's a little bit more confident going forward and he's got the ability to be better. â€¦ It's definitely been a big growth spurt for him.\"\n\nThe good news for Indiana basketball is that even the coach has found a role in keeping a steady level of production for the team and on the court.

We're really looking forward to seeing where we're going from here. There was an opportunity for us to get something done, but it was too late.\n\n\"We just haven't found a team to really get by. Hopefully they'll find a team with more success in the future, which is what I'm excited about.\"\n\nRauch was at the conclusion of Indiana's homecoming game against the Xavier Musketeers on Saturday.\n\nAt that point, he knew he had missed some opportunities in Indiana's win over No. 17 Georgia. But as long as he didn't turn down that opportunity, he was there for the journey, too.\n\nRauch doesn't believe there wil \r\n<a href=https://www.khangheshlaghi.com/>카지노사이트</a>"
